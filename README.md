 ## Summary
Some recomendation for the CEO would be to reevaluate the cost per ride depending on city type, since ubran has the most rides they could increase that fare to still be able to service other areas without profit loss for drivers. Gathering more information about the demographics of the riders could provide more insight. Along with the cost analysis of why the rural rides have the highest fare yet the least total fare. Some factors worth investigating maybe mileage of ride, time of day or demand of driver.
